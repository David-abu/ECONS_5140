# ECONS_5140
This course provides an applied introduction to modern forecasting and causal inference methods used in economics, policy analysis, and industry analytics. Students will learn to implement these methods in Python, work with real-world datasets, and communicate empirical findings through code, written reports, and presentations.

# Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Produce exploratory time series graphics and decompositions.
2. Apply ETS, ARIMA, structural time series models (BSTS), and Prophet for forecasting.
3. Implement advanced forecasting methods including hierarchical forecasting, ensemble methods, neural networks, and bootstrapped models.
4. Estimate dynamic causal effects using VAR models and impulse responses.
5. Apply the potential outcomes framework to identify causal effects.
6. Use matching, RDD, IV, DID/SDID, and synthetic control for empirical causal inference.
7. Estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE/CATE) using modern ML methods such as DML and causal trees.
8. Implement empirical methods in Python and communicate results clearly.
9. Complete and present forecasting and causal inference research projects.

# Participation and Engagement
Students are expected to attend all class meetings, participate actively, and engage with coding demonstrations and discussions. Students who initially struggle with the content but take advantage of self-checks and opportunities for instructor help or peer-to-peer mentoring can be successful in this course.

# Assignments
The course includes four data-based assignments, each consisting of a quantitative exercise and a coding component implemented in Python. Assignment instructions and deadlines will be posted on Canvas.

Coding work must be submitted via a GitHub repository, with a link provided on Canvas. All work must be independent, though students may discuss ideas and approaches with classmates. There are no formal exams in this course. Extensions require a documented compelling excuse.
